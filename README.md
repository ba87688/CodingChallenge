Coding Challenge 


Detail:

1. Retrofit @GET request is used to gather the fonts from the JSON object. 

2. Spinner is used to give user options to change fonts.

3. On Item Listner for the Spinner is used by user to change the font. When user is ready to commit, a button is used to change font of text when it is clicked. 

4. AsyncTask was used to download the fonts files. 

5. Retrofit @POST is used to send Infromation object that is created to the server. 


What could not be solved:
- I was able to download the font files to the download files, 
but i was not able to change the font. 

Problem: when i used Typeface.createFromFile(filePath), there was an error that i could not solve. I spent hours on this and i can't solve it. The error is Font can't be found. 

The font file is in the download file but it still says it is not found. 

Thank you!
